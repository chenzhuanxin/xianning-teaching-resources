     "In recent years, «slow reading» has become a quiet movement among young Chinese readers. "
     "Unlike skimming through short videos or social media posts, slow reading encourages people "
     "to spend hours, or even days, on a single book. Supporters say it helps them think more "
     "deeply and remember what they read. Some reading clubs in Beijing and Shanghai now meet "
     "weekly, asking members to finish one book a month and share their notes. "
     "Though the pace seems slow, members insist that the habit has changed the way they look at "
     "the world. Psychologists also point out that reading slowly can reduce stress and improve "
     "concentration, especially for people who spend most of the day in front of screens.\n\n"

     "A new study from a university in Wuhan suggests that students who take part in volunteer "
     "work do better in teamwork. Researchers followed 600 high school students for two years. "
     "Those who volunteered at least twice a month scored higher in communication and problem-"
     "solving tests than those who did not. The researchers believe that volunteering gives "
     "students real chances to listen, negotiate and cooperate with others. "
     "However, they also warn that too much volunteer work may take up study time, "

     "sleep problems. At the same time, scientists are studying how TCM works with modern "
